<p>The work begins with a story about the author's childhood, when he wanted to be a cartoonist,
    and the adults did not understand his drawings, and instead of encouraging him to improve,
     they scolded him and urged him to do more serious things like study mathematics, geography and grammar.
     In this way he dedicated himself to studying and pleasing adults, and over time he became a pilot. <br>
     <br>
      On one of his trips his plane fell in the Sahara desert, where while he was trying to repair his plane,
       he met a very young boy. peculiar, that he did not seem tired or bothered by the heat of the desert,
        who without asking anything asks him to draw a lamb,
         in this way the pilot begins to know the little prince better,
          and by the wonders he speaks he realizes that he does not He is not from this planet, <br>
          <br>
           but lives on an asteroid with a rose and two volcanoes,
            and spends his days watching the sunsets and pulling up weeds,
             until one day he decides to leave to see many places and make a friend on his journey.
              He passes through various planets,
               the planet of <strong>the king</strong> where he tries to make him his servant and always orders him what to do, 
               the planet of <strong>the businessman </strong> who only thinks about possessing everything,
               the planet of <strong>the vain</strong> who only saw others as admirers
                the planet of <strong>the drinker</strong>  who drinks to forget his shame,
                 for the planet of <strong>the lamplighter</strong> who is tired of his laborious routine,
                  and for the planet of <strong> the geographer </strong>who claims to know many places but has not left his planet,<br>
                  <br>
                   after telling the pilot about his trip, he also tells him about his journey in the land of the garden of roses 
                   that he found and that reminded him of his rose, and of the fox that taught him to tame a friend,
                    and that told him a secret before saying goodbye "what is essential is invisible to the eyes,
                     it can only be seen well with the heart" after <br>

                     the little prince wants to return to his planet, he takes the lamb that the pilot drew for him,
                      and with great regret at not seeing his friends again, the pilot and the fox return to their planet.

<h2 id="c">the writer's main argument</h2>

    
    <p>It is interesting to see how the author, through all the elements of the work,
       tries to invite us to rediscover the simple truths of life that we tend to forget when we become adults. <br>
       <br> 
        He shows us how when we get older we focus on the superficial and forget about feelings.
         profound, losing the ability to be amazed by the everyday. <br>
          He leads us to reflect on how adults are often so trapped in our 
          small worlds that we can no longer appreciate what is
           "invisible to the eyes."</p>
           <br>
           <br>
   <h2 id="g">Personal criticism of the work</h2>
   <p>From my point of view, the little prince is a story 
      about how a child can see the essential things in life more clearly than we adults.
       The little prince invites us in all its chapters to take a break, to get out of our own minds
       , of business, excesses, ego and vanity and sit down to think about what is really the essential thing in life, and recover our vision,
        <strong>learn to tame friends, and see the beauty of a flower.</strong></p>
